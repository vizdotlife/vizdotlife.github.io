## What's Viz.Life?
Well, quite simply Viz.Life was created to be a place where I can write stories about my life exploring the world and creating art along the way that's initially inspired by those moments in the journey along the way. Some of the art ideas I get are from photographs I take, but they usually develop into something more with unique twists in the final outcome of the NFTs in the collection. 

I hope you enjoy the stories I write and the art produced along the way.
