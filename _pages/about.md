## What's Viz.Life all about?
Well, quite simply Viz.Life was created to be a place where I can write about my adventures exploring the world and creating art pieces that are inspired about those moments in the journey along the way. Some of the art I create are initially inspired by the photographs I take, but typically have unique twists to the final outcome of the piece I've decided to add to the NFT collection. 

I hope you enjoy the stories I write and the art produced along the way.
