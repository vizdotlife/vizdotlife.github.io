Well, quite simply Viz.Life is a place where I can share my experiences exploring the world and creating art along the way. Some of the art I create are initially inspired by photographs while others are just trying new ideas. 

This is a place for me to let my spirit be free and not restricted. 

## How many CNFT Collections do you have?
I've broken out my work into two different collections, one for art and the other for photography. At some point there will be a third collection focused on data visualization. 

## Is each CNFT a unique 1/1? 
Yes, all CNFTs within both collections are unique 1/1 pieces. What that menas is there is each one has it's own characteristics that isn't included in any other piece. 

## Does the number of CNFTs in each collection grow over time? 
Yes, the number of CNFTs in my collections will grow over time but please keep in mind that each minted CNFT will alays be a unique 1/1 piece. So even though the number of art and photography pieces in collections will go up it's more just a reflection of growth and expressing new ideas in the journey. 

## How often do you add new CNFTs into collections?
There is no set timeline or dates when new CNFTs are minted and added to collections, but I'm trying my best to continually grow and add new pieces fairly regularly. I believe the best work I can produce for the collections will be when I don't restrict myself to specific deadlines or dates. 

Sometimes I might spend a great deal of time on a specific art piece that needs more work before ultimately minting into the collection.  

## How can I contact you?
The best ways to get in touch are either through Discord in my server or on Twitter. Those are the two primary social spots I'm active in. 

## Anything else?
Nothing else to share other than I hope you enjoy the CNFTs I create and the crypto journey.
