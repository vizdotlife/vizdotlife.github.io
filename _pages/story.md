Nice to meet you. My name is Troy and I'm an independent videographer, photographer, artist, and motion designer. And Viz Life Studio is where I get to share all these projects with the world. 

For the longest time I tried to pick a niche to focus on, but I realized that it's totally fine to be passionate and interested in so many different areas. And that's what you'll see here. 

I've embraced the journey and learning new things everyday.
