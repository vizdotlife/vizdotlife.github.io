Nice to meet you. My name is Troy and I'm an independent artist, photographer, videographer, and motion designer. I also enjoy recording unique sounds. 

And Viz Life Studio is where I get to share all these projects with the world. 

For the longest time I tried to pick one specific niche to focus on, but I realized that it's just not me. I'm passionate about so many different areas and it's enjoyable to share some of those experiences with you. And that's what you'll see here. 

I've embraced the journey and learning new things everyday.
