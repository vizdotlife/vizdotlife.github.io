# Upcoming Collection
![](/images/headers/banner-22.jpg) 

## Generative Art using AI
This is a generative art collection created using AI with Midjourney. That being said I still spent a great deal of time crafting countless prompts, iterations, and curation.

## How much? 
80 ADA per piece 

There's a fee charged per mint with JPG and I'm trying to account for that in the minting price.

## Wen?
Launch date is still TBD, but it's highly likely going to be way before February 28th, possibly in early February. Most of the decision is based on the collection size since more pieces will require more time to create. I'm trying to make pieces every day. 

## How was the art created?
This is a generative art collection created using AI with Midjourney. That being said I still spent a great deal of time crafting countless prompts, iterations, and curation. 

## How can we buy? 
The launch will be broken out into three phases broken out below.

## Phase 1
 The first phase is a Holders Only Mint that will last 24 hours. This will be for collectors who hold at least one piece in any of my collections.

**Viz Collections include:**
- [Viz.Life Art Collection](https://www.jpg.store/collection/vizlifeartcollection)
- [Twilight](https://www.jpg.store/collection/twilight)
- [The Straw Family](https://www.jpg.store/collection/thestrawfamily)
- [Viz.Life - Dancing Sunflower Hybrids](https://www.jpg.store/collection/vizlifedancingsunflowerhybrids)
- [Viz.Life Photos Collection](https://www.jpg.store/collection/vizlifephotoscollection)

The exact breakout between the Holders Only Mint versus Public Mint hasn't been decided yet, but I'm going to try my best to design the right structure. 

If there is any remaining supply that was allocated towards the Holders Only Mint it will be allocated to Phase 2, which is the Public Mint. 

## Phase 2
 The second phase will be a Public Mint where anyone can mint. 

## Phase 3
 The last phase will towards giving a small portion of the collection as thank you gifts to random holders based on unique asset IDs across all my collections just like last time, but the final number hasn't been decided yet.

## What is the collection size?
The total collection supply has not been decided yet, but it's most likely going to be in the range of 100-150 unique 1/1 piece. Having a little bit larger collection size might help give more new folks a chance to get a piece if they want one and also grow the unique collectors base. 

## What platform will this collection be launched on?
I'm excited to share that the JPG team reached out to me in the first few days of January to ask if I'd like to be in their first ever beta platform for creators to launch collections and after careful review of the capabilities I've gladly accepted. 

It's exciting because I'll be in their first ever beta program and batch of collections being launched on their new platform! 

As much as I wanted to structure my next mint like Twilight where buyers could pick which piece they like, I decided not to because I discovered there are now bots that can sweep floors of listed assets of a collection on JPG automatically in one transaction. And I fear that could be used for my next collection and be owned by a small percent of people. 

## Will there be another series for this theme?
Given I'm a free spirit and I love to try and explore new ideas often, there will most likely not be a series 2 for this specific themed collection, but I do plan to continue to perfect this style with new collections in the future with new ideas and themes. 

## What about other new collections in the future?
Absolutely, yes! I most definitely want to continue creating new art collections in the future depending on demand of my art. But it will most likely be uniquely different than previous collections. This makes it more fun for me to keep creating.
