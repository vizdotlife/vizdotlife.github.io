## Wen?
The plan is to launch on December 14th at 15:00:00 UTC. 

There is a chance this could be pushed to December 15th at the same time, but unlikely. I leave this option open due to a few factors outside of my control including getting my collection approved by JPG in advance of the launch.

I will to do my best to follow through with one of those dates and times. Ideally I want to launch on December 14th. 

## How much? 
75 ADA per piece

## How was the art created?
This is a generative art collection created using AI with Midjourney. That being said I still spent a great deal of time crafting countless prompts, itetions, and curation. 

## How can we buy? 
I've decided to launch simply by listing all pieces for sale in the entire collection for sale on JPG so that everyone can pick something they like. 

Given this has been a brutal year for so many, I want people to be happy with what theyâ€™re getting and tastes of everyone are totally different. 

Creators have the ability to hide a collection on JPG before launching and that's what I'm going to do. 

## Why isn't their a WL? 
I'd love to give holders WL spots before releasing the collection to the public, but I'm technically not there yet on my Discord server. 

If in the future my new limited collections get difficult for current holders to get one I'm keeping open the idea to build a WL for holders that give them a first chance to get any new collections I might release. As of right now though I'm unable to do that. This will be a goal I will try to achieve in 2023.  
## What is the collection size?
60 pieces in total for the entire collection, each of which will be a unique 1/1 piece. 

10% of total collection supply (6 pieces) will be given as thank you gifts to current holders in a lottery process. The random lottery picks will be based on unique asset IDs across all my collections. 

In turn that means 54 pieces will be listed for sale on JPG, while the other 6 will be given as gifts to existing holders.

## Will there be another series for this theme?
Given I'm a free spirit and I love try and explore new ideas often, there will most likely not be a series 2 for this specific themed collection. 

There are just too many more ideas I want to experiment with after this one that it would be difficult for me to stay focused that long. I hope you understand.

That being said, I absolutely love space, sci-fi, mysterious and unknown places. So I will definitely continue creating art in these areas, but it just won't be consistent with this theme. Please let me know if that doesn't make sense. 

## What about other new collections in the future?
Absolutely, yes! I most definitely want to continue creating new art collections in the future depending on demand of my art. But it will most likely be uniquely different than previous collections. This makes it more fun for me to keep creating. 

## What would a future collection look like after this one?
The only thing I can say at this point is I plan for all future collection sizes to be 100 pieces or less, and be uniquely different than previous collections. 

There might be times when a collection is only 20 pieces or it could be as upwards as 100. It depends on a lot of factors incuding trying my best to maintain consistency and quality throughout the entire collection, potential demand from buyers, etc.
