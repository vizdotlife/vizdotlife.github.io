## New Collection Launching Soon on Cardano!
![](/images/dawn-to-dusk-part-full-100-v3.jpg) 

## Generative Art using AI
This is a generative art collection created using AI with Midjourney. That being said I still spent a great deal of time crafting countless prompts, iterations, and curation.

## How much? 
80 ADA per piece 

There's a fee charged per mint when using JPG's new launch tool in beta and minting platform, and I'm trying to account for that in the minting price.

## Wen?
Please know in advance that the official launch date could change due to unexpected scenarios outside of my control, but I'm planning for the following:

Feb. 11th - Holders Only Mint (UTC time not set yet)  

Feb. 12th - Public Mint (UTC time not set yet)  

## How was the art created?
This is a generative art collection created using AI with Midjourney. That being said I still spent a great deal of time crafting countless prompts, iterations, and curation. 

## How can we buy? 
The launch will be broken out into three phases broken out below.

## Phase 1: Holders Only Mint
 The first phase is a Holders Only Mint that will last 24 hours. This will be for collectors who hold at least one piece in any Viz collection (listed below). It's very important to note that assets listed on secondary marketplaces at the time of the snapshot will not be eligible for the Holders Only Mint phase. 

**Viz Collections include:**
- [Viz.Life Art Collection](https://www.jpg.store/collection/vizlifeartcollection)
- [Twilight](https://www.jpg.store/collection/twilight)
- [The Straw Family](https://www.jpg.store/collection/thestrawfamily)
- [Viz.Life - Dancing Sunflower Hybrids](https://www.jpg.store/collection/vizlifedancingsunflowerhybrids)
- [Viz.Life Photos Collection](https://www.jpg.store/collection/vizlifephotoscollection)

The exact breakout between the Holders Only Mint versus Public Mint hasn't been decided yet, but I'm going to try my best to design the right structure. 

If there is any remaining supply that was allocated towards the Holders Only Mint it will be allocated to Phase 2, which is the Public Mint. 

### Will it be required to join the Discord server to be eligible for Phase 1? 
No, there is no requirement to join my Discord server to be eligible for Phase 1 but we'd be happy to have you. 

## Phase 2: Public Mint
 The second phase will be a Public Mint where anyone can mint. 

## Phase 3: Thank You Gifts 
 All holders who qualify to be a part of Phase 1 for the Holders Only Mint will be included in this last phase that's focused on giving a small portion of the new collection as thank you gifts to random holders who qualify to be a part of Phase 1 for the Holders Only Mint. 

Random picks are based on unique asset IDs across all my collections just like last time, but the final number hasn't been decided yet.
 
 Important to note that assets listed on secondary marketplaces will not be eligible for the lottery process in Phase 3. 

## What is the collection size?
100 unique 1/1 pieces in the entire collection.

## What platform will this collection be launched on?
[JPG.store](https://www.jpg.store/)

I'm excited to share that the JPG team reached out to me in the first few days of January to ask if I'd like to be in their first ever beta platform for creators to launch collections and after careful review of the capabilities I've gladly accepted. 

It's exciting because I'll be in their first ever beta program and batch of collections being launched on their new platform! 

As much as I wanted to structure my next mint like Twilight where buyers could pick which piece they like, I decided not to because I discovered there are now bots that can sweep floors of listed assets of a collection on JPG automatically in one transaction. And I fear that could be used for my next collection and be owned by a small percent of people. 

## Will there be another series for this theme?
Given I'm a free spirit and I love to try and explore new ideas often, there will most likely not be a series 2 for this specific themed collection, but I do plan to continue to perfect this style with new collections in the future with new ideas and themes. 

## What about other new collections in the future?
Absolutely, yes! I most definitely want to continue creating new art collections in the future depending on demand of my art. But it will most likely be uniquely different than previous collections. This makes it more fun for me to keep creating.
