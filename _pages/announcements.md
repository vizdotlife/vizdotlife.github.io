## Wen?
The plan is either December 14th or December 15th at around 15:00:00 UTC. 

Please note the date and time could possibly change because there are a few things outside of my control including how long it takes for JPG to approve my collection once I have it ready. I'm going to do my best to follow through with one of those dates and times. Ideally I want to launch on December 14th. 

## How much? 
75 ADA per piece

## How was the art created?
This is a generative art collection created using AI with Midjourney. That being said I still spent a great deal of time crafting countless prompts, itetions, and curation. 

## How can we buy? 
I've decided to launch with simply listing all pieces for sale in the entire collection for sale on JPG so that everyone can pick something they like. 

Given this has been a brutal year for so many, I want people to be happy with what theyâ€™re getting and tastes of everyone are totally different. And I'm also concerned with potential bot attacks right now even with WLs. 

I'd love to give holders WL spots before launching to everyone, but I'm technically not there yet on my Discord server. 

If in the future my new limited collections get difficult for current holders to get one I'm keeping open the idea for building a WL for holders to have a first chance to get one if they want to. As of right now though I'm unable to do that. This will be a goal I will try to achieve in 2023. 

## What is the collection size?
60 pieces in total for the entire collection, each of which will be a unique 1/1 piece. 

## dd
I'm going to be allocating 10% of the upcoming collection to existing holders of any of my collections as art gifts based on a list of random unique asset IDs across all my collections.

## Will there be a series 2 for this specific themed collection?
Given I'm a free spirit and I love try and explore new ideas often, there will most likely not be a series 2 for this specific themed collection. There are just too many more ideas I want to experiment with after this one that it would be difficult for me to stay focused that long. I hope you understand.

That being said, I absolutely love space, sci-fi, mysterious and unknown places. So I will definitely continue creating art in these areas, but it just won't be consistent with this theme. Please let me know if that doesn't make sense. 

## What about other new collections in the future?
Absolutely, yes! I most definitely want to continue creating new art collections in the future depending on demand of my art. But it will most likely be uniquely different than previous collections. This makes it more fun for me to keep creating. 

## What would a future collection look like after this one?
The only thing I can say at this point is I plan for all future collection sizes to be 100 pieces or less, and be uniquely different than previous collections. 

There might be times when a collection is only 20 pieces or it could be as upwards as 100. It depends on a lot of factors incuding trying my best to maintain consistency and quality throughout the entire collection, potential demand from buyers, etc.
