## Wen?
The plan is either December 14th or December 15th at around 15:00:00 UTC. 

Please note the date and time could possibly change because there are a few things outside of my control including how long it takes for JPG to approve my collection once I have it ready. I'm going to do my best to follow through with one of those dates and times. Ideally I want to launch on December 14th. 

## How can we buy? 
Given this has been a brutal year for so many I’ve decided the launch will simply be listing all pieces in the collection for sale on JPG so everyone can pick something they like. I want people to be happy with what they’re getting and tastes of everyone are totally different.

And I'm concerned with potential bot attacks right now even with WLs. 

I'd love to give holders WL spots before launching to everyone, but I'm technically not there yet on my Discord server. If in the future my new limited collections get difficult for current holders to get one I'm keeping open the idea for building a WL for holders to have a first chance to get one if they want to. As of right now though I'm unable to do that.

## How much? 
75 ADA per piece

## What is the collection size?
The entire collection will be a total of 60 pieces, each of which will be a unique 1/1 piece. There will not be anymore pieces added in the collection in the future. 

## How was the art created?
This is a generative art collection created using AI with Midjourney. That being said I still spent a great deal of time crafting countless prompts, itetions, and curation. 

## Will there be a future series after this?
