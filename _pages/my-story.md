Well, to put it simply Viz.Life is a place where I can share with the world what I'm working on, which is mostly creating art, photography, and experimenting with new ideas. 

My name is Troy and I'm a Cardano based digital artist that greatly enjoys creating abstract art, fine art, and photography. Each individual piece in my collections are unique 1/1, which means no other piece will be the same. 

Part of the enjoyment I have in creating art is the ability not to be restricted from trying new ideas and that is why you see many different art styles and colors in the collection. 

I'm forever grateful for the support from collectors, family, and friends along this journey.

## How many CNFT Collections do you have?
I've separated my work into two different collections, one for art and the other for photography. At some point there will be a third collection focused on fully on-chain art. 

## Is each CNFT a unique 1/1? 
Yes, all CNFTs in my collections are unique 1/1 pieces.

## Does the number of CNFTs in each collection grow over time? 
Yes, the number of CNFTs in my collections will grow over time but please keep in mind that each minted CNFT will always be a unique 1/1 piece. So even though the number of art and photography pieces will go up it's more just a reflection of growth and expressing new ideas in the journey. 

## How often do you add new CNFTs into collections?
There is no set timeline or dates when new CNFTs are minted and added to collections, but I'm trying my best to continually grow and add new pieces fairly regularly.

## Anything else?
I also sporadically write articles about NFTs on an entirely different website, but art is my passion and focus right now. Feel free to check out what I've been up to there here.
