Well, to put it simply Viz.Life is a place where I can share with the world what I'm working on, which is mostly creating art, photography, and experimenting with new ideas. 

My name is Troy and I'm a digital artist that greatly enjoys creating 3D art in Blender, generative art using AI, abstract art, fine art, and photography. 

Part of the enjoyment I have in creating art is the ability to not be restricted from trying new ideas and that is why you see many different art styles and colors in my work. 

I'm forever grateful for the support from family, friends, collectors, and followers along this journey. 

Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter.
