Well, to put it simply Viz Life Studio is a place where I can share with the world what I'm working on, which is mostly around motion design nowadays. 

My name is Troy and I started learning Blender back in May of 2023. For a little under a year I was learning many aspects of Blender across different areas to get a sense of things and then in April of 2024 I got into creating abstract art animations. And soon after that I felt like I found my niche and haven't looked back since. 

I'm forever grateful for the support from family, friends, and followers along this journey. 

Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter.
