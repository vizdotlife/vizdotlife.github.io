## What's Viz.Life?
Well, quite simply Viz.Life is a place where I can share my experiences exploring the world and creating art along the way that's initially inspired by those moments in time. Some of the art I create are initially inspired by photographs I take in the journey.

Each CNFT within the art collection is a unique 1/1, which means each one has their own characterists that aren't included in any other piece. 

## How many pieces are in the CNFT collection?
The CNFT art collection itself continues to grow over time as I create new pieces, but each and every CNFT is a unique 1/1 piece.

I hope you enjoy the stories I write and the art produced along the way.
